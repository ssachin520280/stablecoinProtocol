 * @title DSCEngine (Decentralized Stablecoin Engine)
 * @author Sachin Anand
 * @notice This is the core contract of the DSC System that handles all business logic
 * @dev This contract handles the collateral deposits, minting, redemption, and liquidation logic
 *
 * The system works as follows:
 * - Users deposit collateral (WETH, WBTC)
 * - Users can borrow DSC against their collateral
 * - Maintains 1 DSC = 1 USD peg through overcollateralization
 * 
 * Core Properties:
 * - Exogenous Collateral: Backed by assets outside the protocol (WETH, WBTC)
 * - Dollar Pegged: 1 DSC = 1 USD
 * - Algorithmically Stable: No governance, pure code-based decisions
 * - Overcollateralized: Each DSC is backed by > $1 of collateral
 *
 * Inspiration:
 * This system is similar to MakerDAO's DAI but with key differences:
 * - No governance
 * - No stability fees
 * - Only WETH and WBTC as collateral
 * - Simplified, minimal implementation
 *
